## Project Overview
### Task:
Create a simple application that, using an API, displays a list of cat (or dog) breeds with photos in a grid layout. When clicking on a cell, a page with detailed information about the breed should open.

### API Used:

## The Cat API
### Features
- Display cat breeds in a grid layout using photos.
- Show detailed information for each breed upon selection.
- SwiftUI is used for the interface.
- Caching implemented for images and breed details.
- Unit tests written for the application's logic.
- Async/await used for asynchronous operations.
- Core separated into specific modules:
  - CoreUI
  - CoreNetworking
  - CoreModel
- Additional bonuses implemented:
  - Lazy loading for efficient data fetching.
  - Landscape support for better orientation handling.
  - Text search to filter breeds by name.
## Architecture
The application is structured following best practices with a clear separation of concerns into modules: CoreUI, CoreNetworking, and CoreModel. This allows for better modularity and maintainability.

- CoreUI: Handles the layout and presentation of the user interface using SwiftUI.
- CoreNetworking: Manages all networking tasks, such as fetching data from The Cat API.
- CoreModel: Contains model definitions and business logic.
## Technologies Used
- Swift 6
- SwiftUI
- SwiftTesting for unit tests
- Async/Await for managing asynchronous code
- Modular architecture
